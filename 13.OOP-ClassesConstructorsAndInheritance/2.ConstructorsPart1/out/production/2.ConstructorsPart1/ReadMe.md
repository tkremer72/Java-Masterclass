# Bank Account

Create a new class for a bank account
Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number

create getters and setters for each field. 

create two additional methods
    1. To allow the customer to deposit funds(this should increment the balance field)
    2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds, this should deduct from the balance field,
    but not allow the withdrawl to complete if there are insufficient funds.
    You will want to create various code in the Main class, to confirm your code is working
    Add some System.out.printlns in the two methods above as well.
