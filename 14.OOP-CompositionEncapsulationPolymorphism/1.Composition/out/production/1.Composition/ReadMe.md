# Composition

Composition - another component of Object Oriented Programming.  Where inheritance 
deals with "is a" relationships, composition deals with "has a" relationships. Composition
models parts of the greater whole.  An example of this is that a computer has a case, a 
computer has a motherboard, and a computer has a processor, and while a computer has 
these things, these things are not a computer.
