# Composition

Composition - another component of Object Oriented Programming.  Where inheritance 
deals with "is a" relationships, composition deals with "has a" relationships. Composition
models parts of the greater whole.  An example of this is that a computer has a case, a 
computer has a motherboard, and a computer has a processor, and while a computer has 
these things, these things are not a computer.
To determine if you should use inheritance or if you should use composition, think about 
what you will need access to or need to access.
