# Encapsulation
    The mechanism that allows you to restrict access to certain components in 
the objects that you are creating.  Guards against unauthorized access.

Issues from not using encapsulation
Allows other classes to take control of each other throughout the application
Any changes in one class need to be made in all classes throught the application
May forget to initialize fields
A constructor in the class allows us to make sure fields are initialized and valid
Can make changes to code without affecting any other code 
Encapsulation Challenge

Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques
the class will be called Printer
It will simulate a real computer printer
It should have fields for the toner level, number of pages printed, and
also whether its a duplex printer(capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
Add methods to fill up the toner(up to a maximum of 100%), another method to
simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).
Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is 
needed.
