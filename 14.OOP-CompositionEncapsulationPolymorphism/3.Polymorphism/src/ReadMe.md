# Polymorphism
Mechanism in Object Oriented Programming that allows actions to act 
differently based on the action object that the action is being performed on.


Polymorphism challenge
We are going to go back to the car analogy
Create a base class called Car
It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class.
engine, wheels, cylinders, etc.
Constructor should initialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4
and engine to true.  Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.
Create appropriate getters.
Create some methods like startEngine, accelerate and brake

Show a message for each in the base class
Now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles
Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use.
put all classes in one java file(this one).
