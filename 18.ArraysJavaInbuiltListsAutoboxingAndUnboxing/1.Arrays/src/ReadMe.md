# Arrays

Declaring an array is similar to declaring a regular variable. 

An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type
into a single variable.

The default values of numeric array elements are set to zero
Arrays are zero indexed: an array with n elements is indexed from 0 to n-1 for
example 10 elements index range is from 0 to 9

If we try to access index that is out of range Java will give us an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException which indicates that the index is out of range in 
other words out of bounds.

To access array elements we use square braces [ and ], also known as array access
operator.
