# Arrays challenge exercise

Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in descending order
Descending order is highest value to lowest
In other words, if the array had the values in it 106, 26, 81, 5 and 15, your program should
ultimately have an array with 106, 81, 26, 15 and 5 in it.
Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard
Implement the following methods.  getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from the keyboard.
printArray printes out the contents of the array.
and sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into the new
array and sort them and return the new sorted array.
