# Inner Classes

Nested classes, there are four types of nested classes.
1. Static nested class - associate a class with its outer class - identical
   a top level class, but the difference is that it's packaged in it's outer
   class rather than in the package. It can't access the non static methods 
   or members of its outer class without first creating an instance of that 
   class.
   
2. Non-static nested class - inner class
3. Local class - inner class that's defined inside a scope block
4. Anonymous class - is a nested class without a classname
