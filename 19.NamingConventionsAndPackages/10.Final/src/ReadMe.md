# Final Statement

the final keyword is used in several contexts to define an entity that can 
only be assigned once. Once a final variable has been assigned, it always 
contains the same value.  Use final on variables that should not change once 
the value has been set.

Static initialization blocks are an advanced feature.  There is rarely a case to use them.
