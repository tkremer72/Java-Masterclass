# Scope 

Scope actually refers to the visibility of a class member or variable.

An example of scope in real life would be if you went to a store, and they had a computer
that you wanted with a 20% off coupon. And you went to another store where the same computer
was full price.  The scope of the coupon would be at the store where it was offered and not
at the second store where the computer is still full price.
Another example using the same computer at a company or store like Walmart, where they offered 20%
off of the same computer, the scope for that would be at the many Walmart stores that are in the 
United States and possibly world-wide.

Methods and classes also have a scope. 

In Java an objects Visibility is governed by the access modifier.

Visibility is connected to scope.
