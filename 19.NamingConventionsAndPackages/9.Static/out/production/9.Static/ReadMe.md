# Static Statement

In the Java programming language, the keyword static indicates that the 
particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of 
that type. This means that only one instance of that static member is 
created which is shared across all instances of the class. This means that 
the variable or method marked as such is available at the class level. In 
other words, you don't need to create an instance of the class to access it.
