# Char and Boolean
A char can only be one character.  Those are the rules for characters in Java.
This comes in handy when you want to store the last key pressed by a user or other
scenarios where you are storing a single piece of information. A Char occupies two
bytes of memory or 16 bits and thus has a width of 16.  The reason it is not just a 
single byte is that it allows you to store unicode characters.

A boolean value allows for two choices, true or false, yes or no, 1 or 2. In Java terms 
we have a boolean primitive type and it can be set to two values only.  true or false.  
They are pretty useful and you will use them a lot when programming.
