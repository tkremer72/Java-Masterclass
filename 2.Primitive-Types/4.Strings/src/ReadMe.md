# String
The string is a datatype in Java, which is not a primitive type.  It's actually
a Class, but it enjoys a bit of favoritism in Java to make it easier to use than 
a regular class.
A string is a sequence of characters, or large number of characters. In the case 
of the char which we discussed in the previous lesson, it could contain a single 
character only.
In Java Strings are immutable, instead of changing the initial string, Java creates
a new textual representation of the original string.
