# Operator Pecedence Challenge
    1. Create a double variable with a value of 20.00
    2. Create a second variable of type double with a value of 80.00
    3. Add both numbers together and multiply by 100
    4. Use the remainder operator to figure out what the remainder from 
    the result of the operation in step 3 and 40.00.
    We used modulus or remainder operator on ints in the course but we can also
    use it on double.
    5. Create a boolean variable that assigns the value of true if the remainder
    in #4 is 0, or false if it's not zero.
    6. Output the boolean variable
    7. Write an if-then statement that displays a message "Got some remainder" if the 
    boolean in step 5 is not true. Don't be surprised if you see output for this step, 
    where you might not expect it to show.
