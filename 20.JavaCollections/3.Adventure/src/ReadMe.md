# Adventure

This project is based off of an adventure game "Colossal Cave" where the player is able to move around
by typing in various compass directions.

Using the split method:
//        String[] road = "You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building".split(" ");
//        for(String i : road) {
//            System.out.println(i);
//        }
//        System.out.println("=============================================");
//
//        String[] building = "You are inside a building, a well house for a small spring".split(", ");
//        for(String i : building) {
//            System.out.println(i);
//        }


# Adventure Game Challenge

 Change the program to allow players to type full words, or phrases, then move to the
 correct location based upon their input.
 The player should be able to type commands such as "Go West", "run South", or just "East"
 and the program will move to the appropriate location if there is one.  As at present, an
 attempt to move in an invalid direction should print a message and remain in the same place.

 Single letter commands (N, W, S, E, Q) should still be available.
