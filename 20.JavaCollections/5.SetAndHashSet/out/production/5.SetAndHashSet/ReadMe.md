# Set & HashSet

A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. 
It models the mathematical set abstraction. ... Two Set instances 
are equal if they contain the same elements. The Java platform 
contains three general-purpose Set implementations: HashSet , 
TreeSet , and LinkedHashSet .

Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash 
table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements 
Set interface. ... HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism 
called hashing. HashSet contains unique elements only. HashSet allows 
null value.
