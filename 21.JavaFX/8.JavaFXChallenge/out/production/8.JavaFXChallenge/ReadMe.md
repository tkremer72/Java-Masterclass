# JavaFX Challenge
For this challenge, you'll create a simple contacts application that has a single main window.  The Application
will allow the user to add a contact, edit a contact, and delete a contact.   You'll display the contacts using
the TableView control.

While we didn't cover TableView in the lectures, we learned everything we need to know to use one.

There will be a single Contacts menu that contains Add, Edit, and Delete items.
You will want to be able to load and store the contacts, which isn't a part of JavaFX topic.
There is a quick and dirty ContactData class that contains a way to load and store the contacts using XML.
