read(ByteBuffer) - reads bytes beginning at the channel's current position, and after the read,
updates the position accordingly.
Note that now we're talking about the channel's position, not the byte buffer's position. Of
course, the bytes will be placed into the buffer starting at its current position.

write(ByteBuffer) - the same as read, except it writes.  There's one exception.  If a datasource
is opened in APPEND mode, then the first write will take place starting at the end of the
datasource, rather than at position 0.  After the write, the position will be updated accordingly.

position() - returns the channel's position

position(long) - sets the channel's position to the passed value.

truncate(long) - truncates the size of the attached datasource to the passed value.

size() - returns the size of the attached datasource
