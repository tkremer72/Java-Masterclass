# Input/Output

Input Output refers to taking information in and writing information out or storing it.

There is no point catching an exception if you don't do anything with it. 

Challenge:
Part 1:    
Modify the program so that it uses a BufferedReader to read in the locations data.

Part 2:
Modify the main method of the Locations class so that it uses a BufferedWriter to 
write the data.

Open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the data has been 
written successfully.

You will then need to make another change to the program to allow for the Q(Quit) 
exits before using the newly created files.

Hint: You may want to change the three instances of HashMap to LinkedHashMap in the 
Location class and one instance in the Locations class so that you can compare the 
files more easily.
