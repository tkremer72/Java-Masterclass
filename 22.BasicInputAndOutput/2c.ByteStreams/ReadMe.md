# Input Output 

Starting over on the Input/Output lecture 230 because at some point my original project got 
messed up, and the instructor uses the same project throughout a lot of this section. 

## Buffered Writer and challenge
Part 1:
    Modify the program so that it uses a BufferedReader to read in the 
locations data.

    Run the program to test it before moving on to part 2.

Part 2:
    Modify the main method of the Locations class so that it uses a 
BufferedWriter to write data.
    Open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the 
data has been written successfully.
    You will then need to make another change to the program to allow
for the 0(Q) exits before using the newly created files.

Hint: 
    You may want to change the three instances of HashMap to LinkedHashMap in the Location class 
and one instance in the Locations class so that you can compare the files more easily.
