Write a method named getEvenDigitSum with one parameter of type int called number

The method should return the sum of the even digits within the number

if the number is negative, the method should return -1 to indicate invalid value

getEvenDigitSum(252); should return 4 since 2 + 2 = 4
getEvenDigitSum(-22); should return -1 since 122 is a negative number
