# All Factors

Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number

If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value"

The method should print all factors of the number.  A factor of a number is an integer which
divides that number wholly(i.e. without leaving a remainder)

For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder.  In other 
words 6/3=2

Example Input/Output
printFactors(6); should print 1,2,3,6
printFactors(32); should print 1,2,4,8,16,32;
printFactors(10); should print 1,2,5,10
printFactors(-1); should print "Invalid Value" since -1 is less than 1
