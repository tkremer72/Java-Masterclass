# Minutes To Years And Days Caclulator
Write a method printYearsAndDays with parameter of type long named minutes.

The method should not return anything(void) and it needs to calculate the years and
days from the minutes parameter.

If the parameter is less than 0, print the text "Invalid Value".

Otherwise if the parameter is valid then it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YYy and ZZd"
XX represents the original value minutes
YY represents the calculated years
ZZ represents the calculated days.
