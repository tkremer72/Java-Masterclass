# Day of the week challenge

Write a method with the name printDayOfTheWeek that has one parameter of type int and name it day.

The method should not return a value(hint: void)

Using a switch statement print "Sunday", "Monday", ..."Saturday" if the int parameter
"day" is 0,1,...,6 respectively, otherwise print "Invalid day".

Bonus:
Write a second solution using if then else, instead of using switch.
Create a new project with the name DayOfTheWeekChallenge.
