Using the for statement, call the calculateInterest method with 
the amount of 10000 with an interest rate of 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8
and print the result to the console window.

backwards to 2%;

if it is a prime number, print it out and increment a count of the number
of prime numbers found if that count is 3 exit the for loop
